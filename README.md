###Internship: Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis testing###

##Statistics and Data Analysis##
• Learned and applied statistical concepts including significance, measurement levels, and empirical rules.
• Conducted hypothesis testing for one, two, and multiple variables, utilizing tests such as t-tests, Wilcoxon sign rank tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests.
• Explored the differences between paired and unpaired tests and their applications.

##Programming and Tools:##
• Developed Python programming skills for statistical analysis, creating scripts for binomial tests, Pearson chi- square tests, Student t-tests, and more.
• Utilized Google Colab and Jupiter Notebook for coding and data analysis tasks.

##Practical Applications:##
• Conducted one sample and two sample hypothesis tests including Fisher exact test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Welch t-test.
• Performed advanced statistical analysis for three or more variables, such as MANOVA and Friedman tests.
• Calculated effect sizes for various statistical tests, understanding their significance in real-world data scenarios.

##Outcomes:##
Demonstrated the ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical data analysis problems.
• Enhanced skills in interpreting and presenting statistical data for decision-making purposes.
• Gained a comprehensive understanding of statistical methods and their applications in Al and data science contexts.
